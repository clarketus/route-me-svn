There are three subdirectories - MapView, Proj4, and samples. Proj4 is a support class used to do map projections. The MapView project contains only the route-me map library. "samples" contains some ready-to-build projects which you may use as starting points for your own applications, and also some engineering test cases. samples/SampleMap and samples/ProgrammaticMap are the best places to look, to see how to embed a Route-Me map in your application.

See LicenseRouteMe.txt for license details. In any app that uses the Route-Me library, include the following text on your "preferences" or "about" screen: "Uses Route-Me map library, (c) 2008-2009 Route-Me Contributors". Your data provider will have additional attribution requirements.
